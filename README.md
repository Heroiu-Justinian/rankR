# rankR
Analyze a text and find out it's complexity(in terms of grade levels),number of words, letters and sentences


# Use (for dummies)
1.In a terminal cd into the directory in wich the program is stored
2.Compile the program using "make rankR"
3.Execute the program using "./rankR"
4.You will be prompted to introduce a text.Paste the text into the terminal and press enter

# Note:
For the best result:

In your text try not to use abreviations such as "mr." or "mrs." as it will throw off the sentence output.
Make sure you have a space after periods at the end of a sentece(except for the end of the text)


Hope it'll help you in some way
